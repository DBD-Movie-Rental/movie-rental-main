Fantastic movie, highly recommended.
Too slow and predictable for my taste.
Great acting, but the story was weak.
Loved the atmosphere and soundtrack.
Not as good as the original, but still fun.
I would watch this again with friends.
The ending completely surprised me.
Visually stunning but emotionally flat.
Perfect for a rainy Sunday.
I laughed more than I expected.
The pacing was off in the middle.
Solid performances across the board.
Felt a bit too long in the final act.
A clever script with sharp dialogue.
The twists kept me engaged throughout.
I couldn't connect with the main character.
A modern classic in the making.
The cinematography was beautiful.
Sound design really pulled me in.
Story felt familiar but well executed.
Not my genre, but I still enjoyed it.
Would recommend to fans of thrillers.
Family-friendly and charming.
Scary enough that I slept with the light on.
A bit messy, but entertaining.
Loved the references to older movies.
The villain was genuinely intimidating.
Strong opening, weaker finale.
Great worldbuilding and setting.
Dialogue felt natural and believable.
Some jokes didn't land, but many did.
The romance subplot felt forced.
I wish there had been more character development.
A bold experiment that mostly works.
Exceeded my expectations.
Underrated and worth discovering.
The soundtrack is now on my playlist.
I lost interest halfway through.
The child actors were impressive.
More style than substance.
Haunting in the best possible way.
Surprisingly emotional and heartfelt.
Good, but overhyped.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
Left me thinking long after it ended.
Pure popcorn entertainment.
A slow burn with a great payoff.
Disappointing given the strong cast.
Very funny with lots of memorable lines.
